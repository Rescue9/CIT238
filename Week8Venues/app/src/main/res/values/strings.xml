    <string name="cdm_history">The Original Cafe Du Monde Coffee Stand was established in 1862 in
        the New Orleans French Market. The Cafe is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It closes
        only on Christmas Day and on the day an occasional Hurricane passes too close to
        New Orleans. The Original Cafe Du Monde is a traditional coffee shop. Its menu consists of
        dark roasted Coffee and Chicory, Beignets, White and Chocolate Milk, and fresh squeezed
        Orange Juice. The coffee is served Black or Au Lait. Au Lait means that it is mixed half
        and half with hot milk. Beignets are square French -style doughnuts, lavishly covered with
        powdered sugar. In 1988 Iced Coffee was introduced to the cafe. Soft drinks also made their
        debut that year.</string>
